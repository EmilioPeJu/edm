EPICS R3.12 Extensions Notes and Build Instructions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

1. Before you can build or really use EPICS extensions, you must set your
   path properly:

   set path = ( $path EPICS/base/tools EPICS/base/bin/HOST_ARCH \
                EPICS/extensions/bin/HOST_ARCH )

      e.g.:

   set path = ( $path /home/epics/base/tools /home/epics/base/bin/sun4
                /home/epics/extensions/bin/sun4 )

2. EPICS base must be configured and built prior to building an
       extension

3. Your epics/config directory must be present and the files properly
   configured prior to building an extension.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Part 1 - Building EPICS Extensions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1  To build all extensions present in your epics tree:

     cd epics/extensions
     gmake            - To build and install all extensions.
     gmake clean      - To clean temporary object files.  Clean will
                        remove files from ALL O.ARCH dirs.

1.2  To build a single extension (e.g. extension xxx):

     cd epics/extensions/src/xxx

     gmake            - To build and install the xxx extension.
     gmake install    - To build and install the xxx extension.
     gmake clean      - To clean temporary object files.  Clean will
                        remove files from ALL O.ARCH dirs.
     gmake build      - To build the extension.
     gmake depends    - To genetate the .DEPENDS dependencies file.

1.3  To create an extension tar file
     These Tar files will be created in the directory ABOVE extensions.
     and are then meant to be untarred at that level.
     They do NOT include the "epics/config" directory.

     cd epics/extensions
     gmake tar.xxx    - Will create an ../xxx.Tar file containing the xxx 
                        extension
     gmake tar        - Will create an ../extension.Tar file containing all
                        extensions in your extensions tree.

1.4  "Partial" build commands:

     gmake clean.sun4        - Cleans sun4 binaries in O.sun4 dirs only
                               (all extensions)..
     gmake install.sun4      - Builds sun4 only (all extensions).
     gmake install.mv167     - Builds mv167 only (all extensions).



NOTES:
     1. Binaries are installed into the extensions/bin/ARCH and 
        extensions/lib/ARCH directories. 

     3. During a normal build (a "gmake" or "gmake install"), the "depends"
        dependency will NOT be invoked.  Only if "gmake depends" is run
        explicitly will dependencies be generated.
     
     4. Temporary objects are stored in src/xxx/O.ARCH, This allows objects
        for multiple architectures to be maintained at the same time.
        While developing source for a specific source file, merely cd
        src/DIR/O.ARCH, and invoke "gmake":

        cd epics/extensions/src/alh/O.sun4
        gmake alh.o

        The above example instructs make to build alh.o for the
        sun4 target.
